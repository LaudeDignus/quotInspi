## What is quotInspi?

What is QuotInspi?

QuotInspi is a simple and attractive web application that provides users with inspirational quotes in a clean and minimalist interface. It's designed for those times when you need motivation, reflection, or something meaningful to read or hear.

The project aims to merge inspiration and accessibility. Not only does the app display random quotes, but it also uses the browser's built-in text-to-speech capabilities to read them aloud, making the experience more dynamic and inclusive.

The project also serves as an educational foundation, demonstrating how to build a responsive application, manage random data, and integrate web APIs, such as text-to-speech, while remaining open source and open to collaboration.
